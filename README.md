# SQL-AirBNB-NY-Projects

This repository contains sql files for both projects, plus the raw data in a csv file. The aim of this project is to demonstrate
SQL skills, whilst discovering trends in NYC AirBnB data, such as the effect of seasonality, location, and time period on pricing
and other variables. Used JOINS, CTEs, subqueries, CASE expressions, window functions, and more.

Next steps for this project could include making visualisations from query results in Tableau, and comparing results with other 
datasets as some results seem puzzling (such low increase in prices over time).
